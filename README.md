# SHT4x

Arduino library for the SHT4x temperature and humidity sensor.


## Description

The SHT4x family is the 4th generation of Sensirion Humidity and Temperature sensors.

This library is build upon the https://github.com/RobTillaart/SHT31 library.
The reason for this (extra) SHT4x library is to have an asynchronous interface like 
the SHT31 library has.

The most important difference with the SHT31 seems to be the way the heater is 
implemented and can be used. More information on how to use properly the heater
can be found in the SHT4x datasheet and in the sensirion application note 
"*Using the Integrated Heater of SHT4x in High-Humidity Environments*"

This library have implemented an over heat protection by blocking heating call
until a certain interval has passed. The interval is mentionned in table below.
The interval is based on a 10% duty cycle for 200 mW. Thus, the average power is
limited to 20 mW.

The library is not tested and verified 100% so feedback is welcome.

Datasheet used: Version 7.1 – March 2025.


**Accuracy table**

|  Sensor  |  Temperature  |  Humidity  |  Verified  |  Notes  |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-------:|
|   SHT40  |     ~0.2 °C   |     1.8%   |     Y     |
|   SHT41  |     ~0.2 °C   |     1.8%   |     N     |
|   SHT43  |     ~0.2 °C   |     1.8%   |     N     |  ISO/IEC 17025 3-point calibration 
|   SHT45  |     ~0.1 °C   |     1.0%   |     N     |


The datasheet states 3 different accuracies for the SHT43.

For more details, please read the datasheet (check https://sensirion.com )

As always feedback is welcome.


## I2C

The SHT4x family of sensors should work up to 1 MHz I2C.

The library does not support "softWare I2C" based SHT4x.


### I2C Address

The SHT4x sensors have a fixed I2C address, however they can be ordered with 
one of three addresses, 0x44, 0x45 or 0x46. Not all addresses seem to be available
for all the different SHT4x sensors. Check latest datasheet for details.


### I2C multiplexing

Sometimes you need to control more devices than possible with the default
address range the device provides.
This is possible with an I2C multiplexer e.g. TCA9548 which creates up
to eight channels (think of it as I2C subnets) which can use the complete
address range of the device.

Drawback of using a multiplexer is that it takes more administration in
your code e.g. which device is on which channel.
This will slow down the access, which must be taken into account when
deciding which devices are on which channel.
Also note that switching between channels will slow down other devices
too if they are behind the multiplexer.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "SHT4x.h"
```

### Constructor

- **SHT4x(uint8_t address = SHT_DEFAULT_ADDRESS, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** constructor. 
Optional select address and the I2C bus (Wire, Wire1 etc).
- **bool begin()** 
Returns false if device address is incorrect or device cannot be reset.
- **bool isConnected()** check sensor is reachable over I2C. Returns false if not connected.
- **uint8_t getAddress()** returns address set in the constructor.


### Read

- **bool read(uint8_t measurementType = SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SLOW, bool errorCheck = true)** 
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SLOW** : High precision measurement
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_MEDIUM** : Medium precision measurement
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_FAST** : Low precision measurement
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_LONG_HIGH_HEAT** : activate heater with 200mW for 1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SHORT_HIGH_HEAT** : activate heater with 200mW for 0.1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_LONG_MEDIUM_HEAT** :activate heater with 110mW for 1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SHORT_MEDIUM_HEAT** :activate heater with 110mW for 0.1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_LONG_LOW_HEAT** :activate heater with 20mW for 1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SHORT_LOW_HEAT** :activate heater with 20mW for 0.1s including a high precision measurement just before deactivation
  - **errorCheck**: errorCheck = true does the CRC check. Returns false if reading fails or in case of a CRC failure. Equivalent to fast = false in the SHT31 library.
Note that the call to read() blocks for a serious amount of time. 
If needed use the **Async interface** as this allows to do other tasks
while waiting for the measurement. See below.

Meta information about the sensor.

- **uint32_t lastRead()** timestamp of last successful **read()** in milliSeconds since start of program.
- **bool reset()** resets the sensor, soft reset by default. Returns false if call fails.
Note that reset() blocks for 1 ms so sensor can reinitialize.

The following functions will return the same value until a new **read()** call (or async) is made.

- **float getHumidity()** computes the relative humidity in % based on the latest raw reading, and returns it.
- **float getTemperature()** computes the temperature in °C based on the latest raw reading, and returns it.
- **float getFahrenheit()** computes the temperature in °F based on the latest raw reading, and returns it.


The **getRawHumidity()** and **getRawTemperature()** can be used to minimize storage or communication 
as the data type is 50% smaller.
Another application for the raw data, is faster comparison with a previous value or threshold.

- **uint16_t getRawHumidity()** returns the raw two-byte representation of humidity directly from the sensor.
- **uint16_t getRawTemperature()** returns the raw two-byte representation of temperature directly from the sensor.

Note that the temperature and humidity values are recalculated on every call to getHumidity() and getTemperature(). 
If you're worried about the extra cycles, you should make sure to cache these values or only request them after 
you've performed a new reading.


### Error interface

- **int getError()** returns last set error flag and clear it. 
Be sure to clear the error flag by calling **getError()** before calling 
any command as the error flag could be from a previous command.

|  Error  |  Symbolic                     |  Description                   |     notes       |
|:-------:|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:---------------:|
|  0x00   |  SHT4x_OK                     |  no error                      |                 |
|  0x81   |  SHT4x_ERR_WRITECMD           |  I2C write failed              |                 |
|  0x82   |  SHT4x_ERR_READBYTES          |  I2C read failed               |                 |
|  0x83   |  SHT4x_ERR_HEATER_OFF         |  Could not switch off heater   |     not use     |
|  0x84   |  SHT4x_ERR_NOT_CONNECT        |  Could not connect             |                 |
|  0x85   |  SHT4x_ERR_CRC_TEMP           |  CRC error in temperature      |                 |
|  0x86   |  SHT4x_ERR_CRC_HUM            |  CRC error in humidity         |                 |
|  0x87   |  SHT4x_ERR_CRC_STATUS         |  CRC error in status field     |     not use     |
|  0x88   |  SHT4x_ERR_HEATER_COOLDOWN    |  Heater need to cool down      |                 |
|  0x89   |  SHT4x_ERR_HEATER_ON          |  Could not switch on heater    |     not use     |
|  0x8A   |  SHT4x_ERR_SERIAL_NUMBER_CRC  |  Could not switch on heater    |                 |


### Async interface

See async example for usage

- **bool requestData(uint8_t measurementType = SHT4x_MEASUREMENT_SLOW)** requests a new measurement. 
Returns false if this fails. See read() for the possible input.
- **bool dataReady()** checks if enough time has passed to read the data.
- **bool readData(bool errorCheck = true)** errorCheck = true does the CRC check. 
Returns false if reading fails or in case of a CRC failure. Equivalent to fast = false in the SHT31 library. 

### Heat protection interface

- **bool heatingReady()** Return true if enough time has passed to call for another measurement with heat.
- **void setHeatProtection(bool activateHeatProtection)** If activateHeatProtection = true, which is the 
default value at initialisation, heating interval is validated before sending another heating command. If 
false, this protection is deactivated.

### GetSerial

- **bool getSerialNumber(uint32_t &serial, bool errorCheck = true)** errorCheck == true, => CRC check, slower
errorCheck == false, => no CRC check, faster. 


## Future

#### Must

- get documentation right
- test functionality with hardware 


#### Should

- ~~Validate the I2C speed~~ Works between 100 to 850 kHz (not tested beyond)
- check error handling
  - missing or not used codes.
  - set _error where needed.
- optimizations
  - ~~store the delay needed instead of the MEASUREMENT type. (dataReady)~~
- need yield() in some places?
- ~~datasheet page 3: clips humidity in example code~~


#### Could

- ~~move code from .h to .cpp~~
- extend unit-tests if possible.


#### Wont
